I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Bethge Lab](http://bethgelab.org/){:target="\_blank"}, University of Tuebingen. During my doctoral studies, I was supervised by [Harri Lähdesmäki](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/harrila/){:target="\_blank"} at Aalto University, Finland. Before that, I worked with [Taylan Cemgil](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/){:target="\_blank"} in my Master's degree at Bogazici University, Istanbul.

- My name is super easy to pronounce: [chaa-tai](https://forvo.com/word/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fatay/){:target="\_blank"}.
- Check out [Markus' guideline for PhD students](https://users.aalto.fi/~heinom10/guidelines.html){:target="\_blank"}.

#### Ongoing projects
- Lie auto-encoders with [Tolga](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.birdal) and [Matthias](https://bethgelab.org/).
- LLM domain adaptation with Firat and [Beyza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v2cMiCAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
- Continuous-time optimal control with David Leeftink and Steffen Ridderbusch.

#### MSc theses I currectly supervised 
- Realistic online continual learning (with Joschka Strüber).
- Knowledge organization for continual question answering (with Atahan Özer).
- Mechanistic understanding of forgetting in LLMs (with Nitin Sharma).

#### Looking for projects?
- Linear algebraic compression of transformers for efficient inference.
- Continual learning of transformers by low-rank reduction.
- Personalized LLMs via RAG.
- Continual handwriting recognition and its adaptation.
