I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Bethge Lab](http://bethgelab.org/){:target="\_blank"}, University of Tuebingen. I received my doctoral degree from the [Computational Systems Biology](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/csb/){:target="\_blank"} research group, supervised by [Harri Lähdesmäki](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/harrila/){:target="\_blank"} at Aalto University, Finland. Before that, I worked with [Taylan Cemgil](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/){:target="\_blank"} in my Master's degree at Bogazici University, Istanbul. 

My postdoctoral studies involve different aspects of continual learning. In my PhD, I tried to understand how continuous-time models can be used in time-series learning, video prediction and reinforcement learning. Curious about the connections with optimal control. My research interests broadly include
- Continual learning
- Neural ordinary differential equations
- Generative models
- Reinforcement learning
