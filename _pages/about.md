I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Bethge Lab](http://bethgelab.org/){:target="\_blank"}, University of Tuebingen. During my doctoral studies, I was supervised by [Harri Lähdesmäki](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/harrila/){:target="\_blank"} at Aalto University, Finland. Before that, I worked with [Taylan Cemgil](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/){:target="\_blank"} in my Master's degree at Bogazici University, Istanbul. 

My postdoctoral studies are about a mixed bag of machine learning models. I work on
- Lie auto-encoders with [Tolga](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.birdal) and [Matthias](https://bethgelab.org/).
- identifiably dynamical systems with [Çağlar](https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/caglar-hizli) and [Pekka](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=id47-5cAAAAJ).
- optimization for LLMs with Firat and [Beyza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v2cMiCAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

I'm supervising three MSc thesis:
- diffusion models for sketch generation.
- realistic online continual learning.
- knowledge organization for continual question answering.

My name is super easy to pronounce: [chaa-tai](https://forvo.com/word/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fatay/){:target="\_blank"}.
