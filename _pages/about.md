I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Bethge Lab](http://bethgelab.org/){:target="\_blank"}, University of Tuebingen. I received my doctoral degree from the [Computational Systems Biology](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/csb/){:target="\_blank"} research group, supervised by [Harri Lähdesmäki](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/harrila/){:target="\_blank"} at Aalto University, Finland. Before that, I worked with [Taylan Cemgil](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/){:target="\_blank"} in my Master's degree at Bogazici University, Istanbul. 

My postdoctoral studies involve different aspects of representation learning and dynamical systems. I work on
- group theory for disentangled representations.
- lifelong disentanglement with [Sebastian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8vAIQXoAAAAJ&hl=en).
- representations for dynamical systems with [Ilze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AJIXYb0AAAAJ), [Stratis](https://www.egavves.com/) and [Sara](https://saramagliacane.github.io/).
- diffusion models for temporal data with [Elif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elifakata/?originalSubdomain=de) and [Joon](https://www.eml-unitue.de/people/seong-joon-oh).
- prototype learning with [Gözde](https://gozde-unal.github.io/) and [Melih](https://melihkandemir.github.io/).

My name is super easy to pronounce: [chaa-tai](https://forvo.com/word/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fatay/){:target="\_blank"}.
